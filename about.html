    <h2>Our Story – From a Cup at Home to a Café for All</h2>
    <br>
    <hr color="black"><br>
    <p style="margin: 0 10%; font-family:cursive; font-size: 28px;">
Two generations ago, in a quiet little town far from where we are today, our family’s love for coffee began in the most humble of ways.
It wasn’t a business then—just a tradition.
Every morning, the aroma of freshly roasted beans would fill our ancestral home, as our great-grandfather carefully brewed authentic South Indian filter coffee for family, friends, and neighbors who stopped by.

Back then, it wasn’t about selling coffee—it was about sharing a piece of our heart. People came not for a menu, but for conversation, laughter, and the warmth of a perfectly poured cup.

As the years passed, the simple joy of those gatherings brewed into something bigger. The recipes perfected in our home kitchen, passed down from generation to generation, became the soul of what would one day be Namma Coffee Cafe.

From a small, wooden counter in a modest corner shop, we slowly grew—adding more chairs, more smiles, and more love to every cup. Today, our café stands as a blend of that cherished past and a vibrant present: a place where the legacy of tradition meets the energy of a modern coffee house.

And though the space has grown, the heart of Namma Coffee Cafe remains the same:
Serving authentic filter coffee, just the way our ancestors made it—rich, warm, and unforgettable.
